# Modeling-Wine-Price-with-Written-Reviews
In this project, we analyze a data set consisting of 130,000 wine reviews taken from Wine Enthusiast magazine. The data set covers a wide range of wines, mostly concentrated on California and France. The reviews consist of a point score ranging from 80 (worst) to 100 (best) and a brief text (approx. 50 words) describing the wine and explaining the taster's judgment. Additionally, the data set contains the price of each wine, along with certain geographic information (e.g. 'country,' 'province,' 'region,' and 'winery'). Here, we use the sentiment analysis tool TextBlob to generate numerical scores for both the sentiment and subjectivity of each review. We then use several regression models in a stacked ensemble approach to examine the correlation to the target variable 'price.' Our research question is the following: Do the subjective opinions of experts, as expressed in these machine-generated text analysis scores, show some correlation to the price of wines in the marketplace? If a positive correlation exists, this may suggest that expert sentiment generally coheres with that of the general public and may be a useful tool in predicting a wine's profitability.
